Exercise 1

Write a Java application using JavaFx which allows the user to enter student information (see the sample design below). The user will enter full name, address, city, province, postal code, phone number and email in text field controls. The studentâ€™s major (Computer Science or Business) will be selected from two radio buttons. A combo box will display the list of courses for each program whenever the user selects the desired program. A course will be added to a list box whenever the user selects a course from the corresponding combo box. Make sure that the user cannot add a course several times. Additional information about the student will be provided from a group of check boxes (such as involvement in various activities, etc). All the information about the student will be displayed in a text area component. Use simple JavaFX layout managers, such as FlowPane, BorderPane, and GridPane to create the JavaFX GUI of this application.
